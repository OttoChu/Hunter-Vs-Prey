# Hunter-Vs-Prey
This is a game where you play as the Hunter and your goal is to catch the Prey in the shortest amount of turns. 

This game will be updated sometimes. To see what changed, have a look at the *update_log.txt* under the folder named *"docs"*.

## Getting Started

### For those who want to play without installing Python and the dependencies (aka lazy and trust me)

To start the game, you can run the executable file named ***"HunterVsPrey_vXX.exe"*** where "*XX*" is the version number of the game.

### For those who don't trust the executable file

Install the dependencies using the following command:

    pip install -r .\dep\requirements.txt

To start the game, you can run the following command:

    python .\src\Main.py


***Good Luck and have fun!***

## How to Play
* Press 'WASD' to move the Hunter around.

* Press 'E' to toggle the special ability.

### Rules
1. The Hunter is represented as ü¶ä.

2. The Prey is represented as üë®.

3. The Hunter and Prey can move 1 tile in any direction per turn (excluding diagonals).

4. Squares that you can be on are represented as üå≥.

5. Squares that you can **NOT** be on are represented as üóª.

6. If an invalid move is made, your total move count will be incremented by **1**.

7. Toggling your special move will count as a turn.

### Game Modes
You can toggle the following game modes under the settings menu:

- Fog of War (Off by default)

    - You can only see a 5x5 area around the Hunter.
    - The rest of the map is covered by fog.
    - The fog is represented as üå´Ô∏è.

*Currently, there is only one game mode, but more will be added in the future. Feel free to suggest new game modes!*

### Special abilities

You can choose between the following special abilities under the settings menu.

- Jumper (**Default**)

    - Moves 2 tiles in the same direction in one turn.
    - This includes jumping over a mountain.
    - This ability can be used 10 times per game.

- Time Stopper

    - Makes 3 moves in the same turn.
    - During this time, the Prey will not move.
    - This ability can be ended early by pressing 'E' again.
    - This ability can be used 5 times per game.

- Teleporter

    - Teleports to a tile on the map.
    - This is only the 9x9 area around the Hunter.
    - You can only teleport to a üå≥ tile.
    - This ability can be used once per game.

- Spotter

    - Reveals an 11x11 area around the Hunter instead of the normal 5x5 in Fog of War game mode.
    - This ability can be used 3 times per game.
    - This ability can only be used in Fog of War mode. (If Fog of War is off, this ability will turn Fog of War **ON**)

*More special abilities (e.g. Baiter, Shooter) will be added in the future. Stay Tune!*

## Bugs
*The following are bugs that I know of. If you find any other bugs, please let me know.*

- Teleporter ability removes the fog when teleporting to a new location.
    
    - This is because fog is only applied when printing in the print_game_state() function.
    The fog should also be applied to the teleport map as well.

    - Additional note: 
        - If the user tries to teleport to a tile covered by fog, the user will not be able to teleport.
        - This will remove an ability charge from the user.

## Future Updates
*The following are only plans. There might be changes to the finer details.*

1. Add a GUI (using pygame)
    - using pygame to make the game more interactive **(in progress)**
    - using kivy to make the game into an app (maybe)

2. Different types of prey (with different special moves)

3. Better AI for the prey (need to be less demanding to increase map size)

    - Could use Markov Decision Process (MDP) to make the prey smarter (maybe look into this)

    - Could use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make the prey smarter (long-term goal)

4. More types of hunter ability
    - Baiter
        - place a bait in a 5x5 area next to the Hunter on the map (except the wall)
        - the bait should be able to attract the prey to it
        - (only if the prey is close enough (distance to do set later))
    - Shooter
        - shoot a bullet in a straight line in any direction
        - the bullet should be able to kill the prey if it hits it (ending the game if the bullet hits the prey)

5. More game modes
    - Multiple Prey
        - there will be more than one prey on the map
        - the hunter will have to catch all the prey to win
        
6. Add a database
    - need to have different accounts
    - can play as a guest (no account needed)
    - to store the best score of each game mode
    - to store achievements (e.g. fastest win, most turns taken, etc.)
    - a leaderboard for each game mode to compare with other players

7. Add a shop
    - to buy new abilities
    - to buy new skins for the hunter and prey (only after GUI is implemented)

8. Add a tutorial
    - to teach new players how to play the game
    - probably after GUI is implemented
