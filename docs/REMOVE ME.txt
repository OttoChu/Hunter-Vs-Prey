moved the animal, hunter and prey class onto its own file

changed the main game loop so that it can let the hunter make multiple moves on the same turn

set out the template for different type of special moves for the hunter






TODO: Show how many moves left on this turn



Plans for future:
1. add a GUI
2. different types of prey (with different special moves)
