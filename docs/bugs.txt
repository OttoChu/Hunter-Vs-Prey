Bugs

Feel free to contact me if you find any bugs in the project. 
I will try to fix them as soon as possible. 

Here are the bugs that are found in the project:

- Teleporter ability removes the fog when teleporting to a new location.
    This is due to the fog is only applied when printing in print_game_state() function.
    The fog should also be applied to the teleport map as well.

    Additional note:
    If the user tries to teleport to a tile that is covered by fog, the user will not be able to teleport.
    This will remove the an ability charge from the user.
